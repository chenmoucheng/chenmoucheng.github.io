### 目的

In his landmark book on the fundamentals of computer programming,
neatly titled Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, Niklaus Wirth
stresses the power and importance of recursion as "evidently lies in
the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite
statement."  Standing on the shoulders of giants, the goal of this set
of computer experiments is to introduce to the students the basics of
data structures and recursive algorithms using rudimentary
graph-theoretic problems as a vehicle.

### 実験の進め方

In the experiments, the students shall learn the basic data structures
and recursive algorithms for solving a special class of graph
isomorphism problems, as well as its applications in compiler
optimization. At the end of the experiments, each student needs to
turn in a report that includes experimental results and answers to a
set of questions posed in the handout.
